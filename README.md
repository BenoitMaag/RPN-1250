# RPN-1250
Repurposing of the TI-1250 Calculator
The purpose of this project is to repurpose an old TI-1250 4-operations calculator by changing the motherboard and software.
The resulting machine is somewhat equivalent to a HP-29C RPN calculator
The replacement motherboard uses a Microchip PIC microcontroller and a MAXIM LED display driver
The software is programmed in C using the Microchip IDE
